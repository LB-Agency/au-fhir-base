**AU Base Medication** *[[FMM Level 1](guidance.html)]*

This profile defines a medication structure including core localisation concepts for use in an Australian context. 
Wherever possible, the structure for medication information profiled here, has been aligned to the proposed R4 [Medication](http://hl7.org/fhir/2018May/medication.html). In support of alignment it is expected that value of Medication.package.content.item is the same as Medication.code; and the following elements have been profiled to allow a maximum cardinality of 1:

* Medication.package
* Medication.package.content
* Medication.package.batch

The following elements available in STU3 [Medication](http://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/medication.html)  have been removed from the standard structure of R4 [Medication](http://hl7.org/fhir/2018May/medication.html), and for this reason it is recommended use of these elements is not encouraged:

* Medication.isBrand
* Medication.isOverCounter
* Medication.package.container
