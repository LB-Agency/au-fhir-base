**AU Medicare Card Number**  *[[FMM Level 0](guidance.html)]*

This identifier profile defines a Medicare Card Number[<sup>[1]</sup>](http://ns.electronichealth.net.au/id/medicare-number/index.html){:target="_blank"} [<sup>[2]</sup>](http://meteor.aihw.gov.au/content/index.phtml/itemId/270101){:target="_blank"} in an Australian context. 

#### Usage Notes

Medicare Card Number is defined as a 10 or 11 digit number. Whilst 10 digits is not sufficient to uniquely identify an individual it is a supported entry where systems do not support 11 digit content. If required, profiles can constrain this profile further to restrict usage to 11 digits only as desired.
Medicare Card Numbers are not used for uniquely identifying patients, they are identifying information that can be used in conjunction with other elements such as name and date of birth appropriately to confirm identity.
