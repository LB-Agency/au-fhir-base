**AU Diagnostic Service Request** *[[FMM Level 0](guidance.html)]*

This profile defines a service request structure that includes core localisation concepts for use as a diagnostic service request in an Australian context.

Note: The procedure-targetBodyStructure extension should only used if not implicit in the code found in ServiceRequest.code. If the use case requires BodySite to be handled as a separate resource instead of an inline coded element (e.g. to identify and track separately) then use the standard extension [procedure-targetBodyStructure](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/extension-procedure-targetbodystructure.html). 

Forthcoming work around this profile is expected to result in a value set representing the Standard for Pathology Informatics in Australia - Requesting codes bound as a slice on the code element in addition to the existing slice for diagnostic imaging requests in SNOMED CT<sup>TM</sup>.
